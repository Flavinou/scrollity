# How to play
Download the project, unzip it somewhere and just open the `scrollity.html` file in your favorite web browser and see the magic happen.

## Commands
* <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>Q</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> or pressing the keyboard arrows to move the player character.
* <kbd>Space</kbd> to jump (try to jump on the enemy's head...).
* <kbd>Z</kbd> or <kbd>â†‘</kbd> to move up the ladder.

*If you want to "play" again, you'll have to refresh your browser*

Unfortunately, there is no "real game" in this project... only a few basic game engine logic and playing around with 
the JavaScript graphic library PixiJS.
