# How to play
Just open the `scrollity.html` file in your favorite web browser and see the magic happen.

## Commands
* `Z Q S D` or pressing the keyboard arrows to move the player character
* <kbd>Space</kbd> to jump (try to jump on the enemy's head...)
* `Z` or `Up arrow` to move up the ladder

*If you want to "play" again, you'll have to refresh your browser*

Unfortunately, there is no "real game" in this project... only a few basic game engine logic and playing around with 
the JavaScript graphic library PixiJS.
